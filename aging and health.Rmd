health expenditure  from world bank
median age from kaggle via UN 
gdp per capita data from kaggle
 This project will focus on the relationship between the age of a society and other economic factors in order to better understand the economics of specifically how income level and average age influence factors such as gdp growth and government spending. Note (age data is from 2020 due to lack of data for every year )
